      <p>
        Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the University of Utah. I recently defended my PhD dissertation at the University of Michigan. 
        <!-- My undergraduate is from Purdue University.  -->
        <!-- , where        my advisor is <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/" target="_blank">Danai Koutra</a>. -->
        <!-- Some of my interests are child language development, data mining, information theory, and philosophy. -->
        <!-- Some of my interests are data mining, unsupervised learning theory, information theory, and philosophy. -->
        <!-- I'm interested in Computation, Philosophy, and Complex Networks. -->
        <!-- <br> -->
        <!-- <br> -->
        <!-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" target="_blank">non-Markovian processes</a>. -->
        <!-- I am interested in studying systems like the media, community-based movements,
        institutions, and power grids. Methodologically, I'm interested in understanding
        the mechanisms underlying these systems, not just observations about them. -->
        <!-- In order to
        study these, I work on theorizing about the processes underlying them and
        developing computational, graph-based methods for dealing with their complexity. -->
        <!-- <br>
        <br> -->
        <!-- I'm intrigued by how we can reflexively and quickly infer
        general principles through perception (e.g. morphology rules from a bunch of linguistic expressions), and how this relates
        to computation. -->



        <!-- I'm also intrigued by the computational aspect of natural language as a cognitive capacity. -->
        <!-- In particular,  -->
        <!-- I'm curious about how computation in general relates to this specific phenomenon. -->
        <!-- <br> -->
        <!-- <br> -->
        <!-- In a related direction (ask me if you don't see how they are related),
        I am working on summarizing graph-based knowledge bases such that the summary can
        be used to say things about entities about which the knowledge base <i>appears</i> to have nothing to say. -->

        <!-- My current projects are on information theoretic approaches to reflexively infer patterns from knowledge -->
        <!-- graphs, -->
        <!-- My research leverages ideas from information theory and linguistics -->
        <!-- to contribute methods to concisely represent unbounded graphs, such as networks that evolve continually and indefinitely. -->
        <!-- My research leverages ideas from information theory and linguistics
        to contribute methods to represent and utilize graphs that are missing data: data mining with missing data.
        Examples include evolving networks, which only contain the network's past evolution (the future is "missing"),
        traffic networks with segments of trips over the network missing, and knowledge graphs that are missing facts about the world.
        Applications of my work include anomaly detection and city/urban planning. -->
        <!-- I am interested in how learnability, computational efficiency, and information theoretic laws
        help children overcome sparse data to acquire language, and what that means for linguistic theory. -->
        <!-- My research interests fall in linguistics, computer science, and the study of mind.  -->
        <br>
        <br>
        <!-- My research is developing an algorithmic approach to phonology, in which phonological generalizations and representations are the result of learning algorithms grounded in independent psychological mechanisms. -->
        My research attempts to develop algorithmic, learning-based acounts of phonological rules and representations, usually from the perspective of language acquisition.
        <!-- This approach  -->
        My research starts by identifying independently-established psychological mechanisms that could be at play in the process of linguistic development. It then uses these mechanisms as the components of an explicit computational algorithm, which constitutes a hypothesis about the process of human learning. Through evaluation of the hypothesized learning algorithm—in particular its accuracy generalizing to unseen test words, its predicted developmental patterns, and its predictions in experimental settings—the algorithm can be interpreted as providing a learning-based account of the rules and representations that it constructs along the way. These structures need not be posited a priori if they can be demonstrated to be the natural consequence of a learning algorithm that is grounded in independent psychological mechanisms.

        My research is informed by and contributes to linguistic theory, psycholinguistics, and language acquisition. 
        <!-- I use computational models as explicit, testable hypotheses about phonological development. I evaluate my models on natural-language data, such as child-directed speech. In doing so, I compare the model’s behavior to linguistic analyses of the phenomenon and language acquisition results. Moreover, by taking an explicit, computational approach, my models make predictions, which I evaluate by comparing to human behavior in psycholinguistic experiments. -->
        

        <br>
        <br>
        I am also interested the history and philosophy of science, especially linguistics and biology.
        <!-- I embrace the central role of cultural and historical contingency in the structure of language. -->

        <br>
        <br>
        For my research, I have been awarded an NSF GRF, an NDSEG fellowship, and a Richard F. and Eleanor A. Towner Prize for Distinguished Academic Achievement.

        <!-- I primarily use computational models and experimental studies—in tandem—to study the algorithms and representations humans use to learn phonological alternations. I also research how contributions to our understanding of human learners can improve natural language processing. -->

        <!-- I spend a great deal of my time thinking about <i>blick, bnick, grue,</i> and <i>bleen</i>. -->
        <!-- I primarily work in linguistics and computer science, but also think often about -->
        <!-- philosophy, pyschology, evolutionary theory, and neuroscience. -->
        <!-- I am interested in how clever tricks that children use in language acquisition can be used for learning with sparse data, and -->
        <!-- how data mining and learning theory principles might be used by children in language acquisition. -->
        <!-- I also often use information theory in my work. -->

        <!-- Current directions include exploiting sparsity to learn in settings with only positive examples. -->
        <!-- Current directions include learning in two-class settings, where only positive examples are available (no negative evidence). -->
        <!-- Prior research has been in a different sparse data setting: graph mining.  -->
        <!-- Prior research has contributed methods for choosing unlinked pairs of nodes to investigate further with a link prediction -->
        <!-- method or experimental study, identifying subtle patterns in networks that are too infrequent to be discovered by frequency alone, -->

        <!-- My research focuses on unsupervised methods for shrinking datasets under missing or incomplete data. -->
        <!-- To do so, I draw on ideas from information theory and linguistics, such as entropy and insights from language learning. -->
        <!-- My research has contributed methods for evolving networks, which, missing the future, only contain the network’s past evolution, and knowledge graphs, which are missing facts about the world. -->
        <!-- Applications of this work include anomaly detection, suspicious behavior discovery, and city/urban planning, including projects with the City of Detroit on transportation planning. -->

        <!-- <br>
        <br>
        On the side, I investigate the possible effects of data mining objective functions on user well-being. -->
        <!-- In each case, the concise network representation has made new network tasks and scenarios possible. -->
        <!-- My current projects are on identifying inductive patterns—those that generalize beyond the data they were identified in.
        These may be patterns that extend beyond the boundaries of an incomplete knowledge graph, or patterns that reoccur in
        a graph edge stream, even in the presence of concept drift. The methods I work on draw on ideas from information theory and cognitive science. -->

        <!-- Pervious projects I have worked on involved representation learning to capture high-order (non-Markovian)
        dependencies in network trajectories, identifying categories of influencers in social movements, and predicting
        protein binding sites. -->

        <!-- My interest in Complex Networks is driven largely by the mystery of emergence. -->
         <!-- phenomena. -->
        <!-- I also explore graph methods for higher (than first) order Markov chains on networks. -->

        <!-- Currently, I am working on a project looking to automatically and without supervision find
        rules (i.e. a model) in encyclopedic data which is significantly simplified into a graph structure
        while jointly finding exceptions to those rules (or deviations from that model). This is conceptually
        interesting because it is a much more tractable simplification of the general problem of building
        a common-sense model of the world. It has practical applications in web search. -->

        <br> -->
        <!-- Underlying all my work, I try my best to think critically about its implications. -->
        <!-- Right now, there are at least a couple fundamental questions that I especially wrestle with: -->
        <!-- <br>
        I try my best to be responsible with my research, and continually consider whether my work will be constructive or destructive to society.
        <br> -->
        <!-- <br>
        1) What might be the implications of methods I work on? Will they be constructive or destructive to society?
